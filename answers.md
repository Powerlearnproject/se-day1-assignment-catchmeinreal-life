#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.



Software engineering at its root can be defined as: sysytematic application of engineering principes, methods and tools to the planning, designing , development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products taiolored for consumption. 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.



software development - creating computer programmes to perform various tasks, has evolved significantly since its inception. These evolution has been driven by   1.technological advancements. 
                                                2.Changing needs. 
                                                3. Growing complexities of the digital world.
This industry has seen various turning point since the pioneering days where manual and highly technical processes sow developers write machine-level instructions by hand, plus the challenge of limited hardware forcing devs to write efficient and compact code. One of the key milestone is,

1. The Birth of High-Level language ; such as FORTRAN, COBOL, LISP revolutionized software development, where compilers and interpreters came into the lim light simplifying coding process for compilers could translate high-level code to machine code.

2. Personal Computer Revolution; This era brought software development to a wider audience, bringing rise to Graphcal User Interface improving user experience.

3. The Internet Age; world wide web transformed software into a global, interconnected entity, bringing forth Client-Server Architecture, where by client-server models allowed users to interact with web apps.




List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.



Software development is a complex and multifaceted process that transforms a concept or idea into a functuinal, reliable software application, to this to fruition developers follow a stractured process that consists of several key steps.

1. Planning and Requirement Gathering : the first step that involves identifying the needs, objectives, and constraints of the project. Object is to define what the software should do and what problems it will solve.

2. Design: in this phase, the software architecture and user interface are developed. This steo defines how the software will work and how users will interact with it . Design includes creating wireframes, prototypes, and system architecture diagrams.

3. Implementation: Output of the design phase will be implemented in this phase.

4. Quality Assurance: This phase ensures the high quality product. Software tesy=ting is done at this phase, debugging, bug fixing.

5. Go Live/Deployment: at this phase of software development processes the product is ready to launch in the market.

6. Software Maintenance: Process of modifying and updating a software system after it has been delivered to the customer. Might include tasks such as fixing bugs, adding new features, improving performance, or updating the software to work with new hardware or software system.




Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.



Each stand out due to their distinct approaches in the SDLC for they represent contrasting approaches in how projects are planned, executed and delivered.
Waterfall is a traditional, linear approach where each phase of the project is completed in a sequence before moving on to the next one ,works well for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes. In contrast Agile is iterative and flexible, allowing for contionous improvement and adaptations throughout the project lifecycle.

Waterfall=Best for structured, predictable projects:
Say a goverment agency wants to implement a Goverment Health Insuarance System with strict reguatory requirements. The requirements are well-defined, documented, and unlikely to change. The project needs extensive security and compliance testing before deployment. A sequential approach ensures each phase is completed thoroughly before moving forward.

Agile - Best for dynamic, Evolving Projects
Say Buiding a Telemedicine Startup App. A startup where users can consut doctors and book appointments. Requirements are evolving based on user feedback and market trends. The team works in sprints, releasing updates frequently to improve user experience. Agile allows for contionous iteration ensuring the app remains competitive.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.



-A software developer;  responsible for translating features and requirements into lines of code that comprise the software. Developer roles are divided into two categories based on the part of the software they develop. Frontend and Backend Developer.

-A Quality Assurance Engineer: Quality Assurance Leads or Software Testers are in charge of testing the application at various stages of the software's lifecycle in order to identify flaws and ensure that the product is fit for use. Along with the functional aspect, the testing phase includes some other aspects such as the application's response time, portability to ensure the application can be deployed seamlessly on different platforms, and testing the efficiency and ability.

-A Project Manager: /Scrum Master is the executive member of the development team in an Agile team who is responsible for the entire product lifecycle from idea inception to software release. A Product Manager, as opposed to a Product Owner, works primarily with internal stakeholders from a technical standpoint and oversees all phases of the development lifecycle.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.



IDEs provide a scratch book where code is written and maintained and aso comes with toos that come in handy during debugging, testing deployament and code completion extensions, ex is Vs code.

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.  It
allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

 

Throughout the development cycle, various challenges are encounterd.
1. Changing requirements - during development leeding to scope creep and project delays. Solution is to layout the requirements fully or using a more change friendly development approach say Agile methodology.

2. Tight deadlines - pressure to deliver projects on tight deadline leads to rushed development and compromised Quality. Solution is for the product manager to set up manageble timeframe and steer the team towards steps that match the duration of the project.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.



-Unit testing: involves testing individual moduleas or components of software ensuring they are operating as intended.

-Integration testing: is process of testing the interface between two or more software units or modules, it focuses on determining the correctness of the interface and main purpose is to expose fauts in the interaction btwn integrated units.

-System testing :  It is a level of the software testing process where a complete, integrated system/software is tested. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system’s compliance with the specified requirements.

-Acceptance testing: It is a level of the software testing process where a system is tested for acceptability. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system’s compliance with the business requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.



Process of crafting effective prompts to get the best response from AI models. A well layered prompt ensures a satisfactory response from the model in use.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.



vague prompt:
"Build a website for my business."

improved prompt:
"Create a responsive e-commerce website for my clothing business with a homepage, product listing, shopping cart, and checkout page. Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and Node.js with MySQL for the backend. Integrate Lipa na M-Pesa and PayPal for payments."

the improved prompt is more effective:
1. Clarity: It specifies that the website is for an e-commerce clothing business.
2. Specificity: It outlines key pages (homepage, product listing, cart, checkout).
3. Technology Stack: It defines the tools (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MySQL).
3. Functionality: It mentions essential features like payment integration with Lipa na M-Pesa and PayPal.
